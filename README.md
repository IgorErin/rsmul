# Rsmul

Multiplier the matrix on itself in `mtx` format and my first project with `rust` language!

## Usage

Simply `rsmul` in directory with dataset. `rsmul` will find files with matrices (with `mtx` extension), exponentiate them and write them to the same directory. Only pattern data supported now.
